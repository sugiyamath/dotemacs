# Dotemacs Configuration

This is a brief description of the Emacs configuration in the provided dotemacs file.

## Package Management System (package.el) Configuration

The configuration starts by setting up the package management system, `package.el`. It adds "melpa" to the list of package archives and initializes the package system.

## Automatic Package Installation

A list of packages to be installed is defined in the `my/packages` variable. This includes `company`, `cyberpunk-theme`, `web-mode`, and `emmet-mode`. The configuration then checks if each package is installed. If a package is not installed, it refreshes the package contents and installs the package.

## Python Configuration

A function `python-autopep8` is defined to run `autopep8` on the current Python buffer. This function is then bound to the key combination `C-c C-r` in Python mode.

## Web Development Configuration

`web-mode` is required for web development. The configuration associates `web-mode` with `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files. A hook function `my/web-mode-hook` is defined to set the indentation offset for markup, CSS, and code in `web-mode` to 2. This hook function is added to `web-mode-hook`.

## Emmet-mode Configuration

`emmet-mode` is required and added to `web-mode-hook`.

## Theme Configuration

The `cyberpunk` theme is loaded.
